## SQL Query Optimizations

### 1. Event Listing with Registration Count
```sql
SELECT 
  e.*,
  COUNT(r.id) as registration_count
FROM events e
LEFT JOIN registrations r ON e.id = r.event_id
WHERE 1=1
  AND (e.title LIKE ? OR e.description LIKE ?)
  AND e.location = ?
  AND e.date >= ?
  AND e.date <= ?
GROUP BY e.id
ORDER BY e.date ASC
```

**Optimizations:**
- Used LEFT JOIN instead of INNER JOIN to include events with no registrations
- Added indexes on frequently filtered columns (title, description, location, date)
- Used parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- GROUP BY on primary key for better performance

**Pros:**
- Efficient filtering with indexes
- Handles events with no registrations
- Secure against SQL injection
- Scalable with large datasets

**Cons:**
- Requires additional indexes
- GROUP BY operation can be expensive with large datasets

### 2. Popular Events Query
```sql
SELECT 
  e.*,
  COUNT(r.id) as registration_count
FROM events e
LEFT JOIN registrations r ON e.id = r.event_id
GROUP BY e.id
ORDER BY registration_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```

**Optimizations:**
- Used LEFT JOIN to include all events
- Limited results to top 5
- Added index on registration_count for sorting

**Pros:**
- Fast retrieval of popular events
- Includes all events regardless of registration status
- Limited result set for better performance

**Cons:**
- Requires sorting operation
- May need periodic updates for real-time accuracy

### 3. Daily Statistics Query
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(r.created_at) as date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT r.id) as total_registrations,
  COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) as total_events
FROM registrations r
JOIN events e ON r.event_id = e.id
WHERE r.created_at >= date('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY DATE(r.created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC
```

**Optimizations:**
- Used DISTINCT to avoid duplicate counts
- Added index on created_at for date filtering
- Limited to last 7 days for better performance

**Pros:**
- Accurate counting with DISTINCT
- Efficient date filtering
- Reasonable data scope

**Cons:**
- Multiple COUNT operations
- Requires index on timestamp

## Frontend Decisions

### 1. Component Structure
- Used functional components with hooks for better performance and maintainability
- Implemented reusable components (EventCard, RegistrationForm)
- Created a consistent layout with navigation

### 2. State Management
- Used React's built-in state management (useState, useEffect)
- Implemented proper loading and error states
- Added form validation and error handling

### 3. UI/UX Considerations
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Clear navigation and user feedback
- Accessible form controls and buttons
- Loading states for better user experience

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Implemented pagination for event listing
- Used proper image optimization
- Added proper TypeScript types for better development experience
- Implemented proper error boundaries

## Security Considerations

1. SQL Injection Prevention
   - Used parameterized queries
   - Implemented proper input validation

2. XSS Prevention
   - Used proper escaping in React components
   - Implemented Content Security Policy

3. CSRF Protection
   - Used proper form submission methods
   - Implemented proper session handling

## Future Improvements

1. Performance
   - Implement server-side caching
   - Add database query caching
   - Implement pagination for large datasets

2. Features
   - Add user authentication
   - Implement event categories
   - Add search functionality
   - Add event sharing

3. Monitoring
   - Add error tracking
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Add user analytics
